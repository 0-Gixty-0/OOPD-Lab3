Dependencies (with respect to cohesion and coupling, and the Dependency Inversion Principle.)
    Which Dependencies are necessary?

    Which classes are dependent that should not be?

    Are there stronger dependencies than necessary?

    Can you identify any violations of other design principles we talked about in the course?

Classes (with respect to Separation of Concern (SoC) and Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).)
    What responsibilities do your classes have?

    What reasons do they have for change?

    In which classes would you need to apply decomposition to better follow SoC and SRP?
